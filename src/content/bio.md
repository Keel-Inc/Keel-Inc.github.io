I'm Richard Keelan. I have almost twenty years experience building reliable, efficient software that lives close to the hardware. Lately I work remotely for Silicon Valley tech companies, but I spent the first part of my career at a blood diagnostics company as it grew from startup to scale-up and went through multiple acquisitions, ending up as part of one of the world's leading medtech companies.
